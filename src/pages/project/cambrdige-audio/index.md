description: Cambridge Audio came to Potato to help them design an iOS and Android application for a new multi-room speaker range - The Evo system. They also wanted to learn product development and lean UX. Whilst on the project I was the product lead; leading the process; gathering research, planning and running the workshop, running the user testing and leading the design of the application.
