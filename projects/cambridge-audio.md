The Brief

Cambridge Audio came to Potato to help them design an iOS and Android 

application for a new multi-room speaker range - The Evo system. 

They also wanted to learn product development and lean UX.Whilst on the project I was the product lead; leading the process; gathering research, planning and running the workshop, running the user testing and leading the design of the application.
